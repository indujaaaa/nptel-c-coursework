## NOW ARCHIVED. Discontinued updating here, as I've done it on Notion.

## What's in Here?

Coursework from the course **Problem Solving through Programming in C** by **NPTEL**.

## About

This is a personal repo at the moment where I store my work from the course. The repo contains my program solutions from the July/September 2020 semester's course assignments. All solutions are free to use, but I recommend that you code it on your own and not copy the code right away.

The programs in this repo are coded entirely by [myself](https://github.com/indujaaaa), which means it does not utilize the pre-filled code that is provided in the NPTEL tests.

## Future Scope

- Extension of repo by adding the same programs in other languages.
