## What's in Here?

Coursework from the course **Problem Solving through Programming in C** by **NPTEL**.

## About

This is a personal repo at the moment where I store my work from the course. The repo contains my program solutions from the July/September 2020 semester's course assignments. All solutions are free to use, but it is recommended that you code it on your own and not copy the code right away.

The programs in this repo are coded entirely by [myself](https://github.com/indujaaaa), which means it does not utilize the pre-filled code that is given by NPTEL tests themselves.

## Future Scope

- Extension of repo by adding the same programs in other languages.
